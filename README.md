Java Program to Separate Even and Odd Numbers in an Array

Description:

This program takes an array of integers as input and separates the even and odd numbers into two separate arrays. It then prints out the even and odd arrays. This can be useful for various purposes such as statistical analysis, data organization, or simply as an exercise in understanding arrays and conditional logic in Java.


Program Steps:

-Input the Array:
The user provides a list of integers. This can be done via hardcoded values in the code or by taking user input.

-Initialize Arrays: 
Two separate arrays are initialized to store even and odd numbers. Alternatively, ArrayLists can be used for dynamic sizing.
Loop through the Input Array: Iterate through each element of the input array.

-Check Even or Odd:
Use the modulus operator (%) to check if an element is even or odd.
If the element is even, add it to the even numbers array.
If the element is odd, add it to the odd numbers array.
Output the Results: Print the arrays of even and odd numbers.
